# 🌕 **Space 3D Parkour** 
_A 3D Platformer Adventure in Space_  

## 🎮 **About the Game**  
Welcome to **Moonwalk Parkour**, a fast-paced 3D platformer where you must skillfully **moonwalk** through a series of challenging obstacles to reach your spaceship! Your mission is to navigate through perilous space terrain while avoiding hazards that test your timing, precision, and agility. Can you beat the clock and return to your ship before it's too late?  

## 🕹️ **Controls**  
- **WASD** - Move  
- **Space** - Jump  

## 🚧 **Obstacles & Challenges**  
Prepare yourself for a variety of space-themed challenges:  
- **Disappearing Platforms** – Step carefully! These platforms won’t stick around for long.  
- **Moving Obstacles** – Time your movements or risk losing precious seconds.  
- **Pushing Blocks** – Wait for the right moment to slip through safely.  
- **Rotating Poles** – Watch out! These poles will knock you off course if you're not careful.  

## ⏳ **Time Pressure**  
- A timer keeps track of how fast you complete the level.  
- If you take more than **60 seconds**, the timer **starts blinking**, signaling that you're running out of time!  
- For those playing for the first time, hit the red **Reset** button to reset the timer.


## 🚀 **Goal**  
- Reach your spaceship **as fast as possible**!  
- Master your moonwalking skills and beat your best time.

## 🎨 **Visuals & Assets**  
To enhance the game's aesthetics, I used **free assets** from the Unity Asset Store:  
- 🌑 [Low Poly Rock Pack](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-rock-pack-57874)  
- 🪐 [Planets of the Solar System](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/planets-of-the-solar-system-3d-90219)  
- 🚀 [Sci-Fi Space Fighter](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/vehicles/space/sci-fi-space-fighter-pbr-288705)
- I also took **inspiration** from the game **Fall Guys** for fun and engaging obstacle-based platforming.
